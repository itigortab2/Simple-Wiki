# Maintenance Mode

If you are doing some maintenance on your site and need to display a maintenance message TFD provides a Maintenance Mode that displays *content/masters/maintenance.php* no matter what page they are trying to access (including the admin panel).

## Turn Maintenance Mode On

To turn Maintenance Mode on, simply change MAINTENANCE_MODE to true in *content/_config/general.php*.
